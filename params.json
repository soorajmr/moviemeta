{"name":"Moviemeta","tagline":"Movie Metadata Eploration - Harvard CS109 Project Page","body":"*** CS-109 project submitted by Mark Reinke (@mreinke), Wonsun Kim (@wsunkim) and Sooraj Raveendran (@soorajmr) ***\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nPersonal video consumption patterns are changing very fast worldwide, with the traditional satellite and cable infrastructure giving way to internet based delivery. This change has repercussions throughout the video production pipeline, including the emergence of many new entrants. Unlike earlier, content producers and distributors have an easy access to a huge market due to the nature of the internet. In this situation, it becomes very important for these companies to understand the collective preferences of the market well. This is essential for deciding what video content to produce and also for effective targeted advertising or recommendations. Through our analysis, we are making an attempt to contribute to the understanding of the nature of movie preferences of different populations across the world and how they vary over time. \r\nWe were inspired by [a presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkfXBGnDplQ) about recommending clothes by applying word2vec to user reviews and an article that describes [how the New York times apply LDA to recommend content](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/building-the-next-new-york-times-recommendation-engine/?_r=2) to their users.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we apply text mining techniques on a large corpus of movie plot summaries to gain non-obvious insights to the content of the movies. We try to create models of movies for the purpose of studying the nature of collective user preferences. We further do an analysis of the preferences across different geographies. Here we assume that movie preferences are closely tied to the cultural and political environment of a country or region and understanding these nuances will enable us to predict what types of content are preferred by the people of each region. We also carry out a similar analysis across the dimension of time to study the nature of variations in the preference patterns.\r\n\r\n# Data\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
