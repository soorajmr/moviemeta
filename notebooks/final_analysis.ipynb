    "We first tried out LSI and discarded this angle due to the poor quality of the results. We then applied topic modeling with LDA on movie plots and this yielded interesting and plausible results. We discovered the primary themes that are present in films and could identify differences in the films from different cultures. We also saw that the movie preferences of moviegoers from 6 different countries are very similar for the years since 2007. It would have been interesting to see if this also applied in earlier times, but it was not possible for us to acquire such data."
