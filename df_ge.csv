While looking for medical supplies, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes; disenchanted with Koba\'s leadership, the young ape spares Malcolm\'s life and returns to the house with him, where he reconciles with his father.

Lucy delivers a briefcase to Mr. Jang containing a highly valuable synthetic drug called CPH4. After seeing her boyfriend shot and killed, she is captured. A bag of the drug is forcibly sewn into her abdomen and that of three other drug mules who will also transport the drug for sale in Europe. While Lucy is in captivity, one of her captors kicks her in the abdomen, breaking the bag and releasing a large quantity of the drug into her system.

Marks breaks protocol and consults with Jack Hammond, the other air marshal, who concludes that the threat is not valid. Marks however consults the help of Summers and flight attendant Nancy to monitor the security cameras while texting the mysterious person in order to locate him. However, Hammond is texted by the unknown person who says that he knows what is in Hammond\'s briefcase. As Marks confronts Hammond in the rear lavatory, the latter is revealed to be smuggling <a href=""/wiki/Cocaine"" title=""Cocaine"">cocaine</a> in a brief-case. Hammond attacks Marks, who responds in self-defense and breaks Hammond\'s neck. This incident happens exactly at the 20-minute mark.</p>', u'<p>Marks, the pilot, and the co-pilot explain the text messages to the <a href=""/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration"" title=""Transportation Security Administration"">TSA</a>, but the TSA discovers that the bank account was registered in Marks\'s name, and proceeds to accuse Marks of being the author. At this point, the pilot falls dead, being seemingly poisoned, and the time is exactly at the 40-minute mark.</p>', u'<p>Marks makes several attempts to monitor the passengers and search them, causing the passengers to detest him. One of them uploads a video in which Marks accuses and roughly handles school teacher Tom Bowen, convincing the media that Marks is himself the hijacker.

Marks physically abuses the banker, who suddenly dies of poisoning, right at the 60-minute mark.</p>', u'<p>While smoking in the lavatory, Marks discovers a hole drilled into the wall which offered a clear shot to the pilot\'s seat.

He asks a passenger who was the last to use the toilet and she replies that Summers was the last to use the toilet. Marks confronts Summers and accuses her of being the real hijacker and says that her actions throughout the flight were suspicious. Summers proves her innocence and gets upset over being accused of such crimes even though she stood by Marks throughout the flight. Marks apologizes to her and offers her a drink. The passengers view a mid-flight news report via their television sets, saying that Marks is the hijacker of their flight. The hijacker\'s phone suddenly activates, warning that a bomb will explode in 30 minutes. Marks realizes that the bomb would have to be placed in a location such that it could avoid security checks, which was inside Hammond\'s cocaine briefcase. A short while later, some passengers try to attack Marks but Tom Bowen stops them, believing that the bomb is the first priority. Marks persuades the passengers of his innocence, and together they move the bomb to the plane\'s rear and bury it with luggage to reduce the blast\'s damage and move to the front of the plane to avoid the blast. The plane has to descend to 8,000 feet, which is necessary for survival, as the low pressure of higher altitudes would rip the plane apart if the bomb exploded. However the co-pilot is unable to do so as they are escorted by a pair of <a href=""/wiki/Fighter_aircraft"" title=""Fighter aircraft"">fighter aircraft</a> that instructs him to not deviate from his course or altitude without permission from them.</p>', u'<p>Marks, watching the video of himself from earlier, notices Bowen making contact with the banker\'s pocket, suggesting that Bowen put the phone there. At this moment, Bowen is revealed to be the hijacker and runs to the rear of the plane. Marks chases after him but loses his gun to Bowen in a fight. White also reveals himself to be a hijacker. Their goal was to frame Marks for the plane\'s hijacking and destruction, thus ruining the reputation of the Air Marshals Service, which they seek revenge against for allowing <a href=""/wiki/September_11_attacks"" title=""September 11 attacks"">September 11</a> to happen in which Bowen\'s father died. Marks persuades White to disarm the bomb, saying that there is no escaping from this alive. Bowen shoots White before the bomb is disarmed and prepares to kill Marks. Meanwhile, the co-pilot suddenly descends steeply at the last moment against the fighter jets\' orders. In the ensuing chaos, Marks, with the help of Nancy, kills Bowen in a gun fight. White recovers and attempts to kill Marks who subdues him and throws him to the rear of the plane just as the bomb goes off, killing him in the blast and damaging the <a href=""/wiki/Fuselage"" title=""Fuselage"">fuselage</a>. The plane is successfully crash landed with all remaining passengers and crew surviving. An injured Marks is treated by the emergency forces and is praised for being a hero by the TSA and media.

Believing she is depressed, Hazel\'s mother Frannie (<a href=""/wiki/Laura_Dern"" title=""Laura Dern"">Laura Dern</a>) urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to help her make friends who are going through the same thing.</p>', u'<p>One week, Hazel meets Augustus Waters (<a href=""/wiki/Ansel_Elgort"" title=""Ansel Elgort"">Ansel Elgort</a>), a charming teenager who lost a leg from <a href=""/wiki/Osteosarcoma"" title=""Osteosarcoma"">bone cancer</a> years earlier but has since been cancer-free. He invites Hazel to his house and she accepts, where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other\'s favourite book. Hazel recommends <i>An Imperial Affliction</i>, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel\'s experience, and Augustus gives Hazel <i>Counter Insurgence</i>. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends in the middle of a sentence). Hazel explains that the novel\'s mysterious author, Peter Van Houten (<a href=""/wiki/Willem_Dafoe"" title=""Willem Dafoe"">Willem Dafoe</a>), retreated to Amsterdam following the novel\'s publication and has not been heard from since.</p>', u'<p>Weeks later, Augustus tells Hazel that he has traced Van Houten\'s assistant, Lidewij (<a href=""/wiki/Lotte_Verbeek"" title=""Lotte Verbeek"">Lotte Verbeek</a>), and has corresponded with Van Houten by email. Hazel then writes to him to find out more about the novel\'s ambiguous ending and Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person. Overwhelmed and excited, Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie rejects it because of financial and medical constraints. Augustus suggests that she use her ""cancer wish"" since children and young adults with life-threatening illnesses receive one arranged experience of their choice, but Hazel explains that she already used hers to visit <a href=""/wiki/Disneyland"" title=""Disneyland"">Disneyland</a> when she was younger. Augustus and Hazel go on a picnic date, kiss for the first time, and soon begin to fall in love. Augustus also surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam after using his wish on her.

Although initially concerned, her doctors eventually agree to allow the trip, since they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all.</p>', u'<p>Hazel and Augustus arrive in Amsterdam and are presented with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid for by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they get the bus into the city and head to Van Houten\'s house, but are soon shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic; Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner on his behalf without him knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant\'s actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers to a piece of fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly destraught. On their way back to the hotel, Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the <a href=""/wiki/Anne_Frank_House"" title=""Anne Frank House"">Anne Frank House</a>, where Hazel struggles to climb the house\'s many stairs. At the end of the tour, Augustus and Hazel kiss to the applause of many fellow tourists. They spend that night together in their hotel and make love for the first time. The next day while out in the city, Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has relapsed, has spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.</p>', u'<p>After their return to Indianapolis, Augustus\' health worsens each week. Hazel receives a desperate call from him late at night after he tries to get a new pack of cigarettes at the gas station. He is taken to the ICU for a few days and realizes he is close to death. Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac (<a href=""/wiki/Nat_Wolff"" title=""Nat Wolff"">Nat Wolff</a>) and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies they\'ve both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything, since he ""gave me a forever within the numbered days.""</p>', u'<p>Augustus dies eight days later. At his funeral, Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten in attendance. He tells her he maintained correspondence with Augustus after Amsterdam and that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. He then tells Hazel that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. Van Houten tries to tell Hazel about the fate of Anna\'s mother; he gives Hazel a piece of paper. Hazel, still upset with his behavior in Amsterdam, crumples up the paper and asks him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads Augustus\' words, which state his acceptance of death and his love for Hazel.

Zubrowka is on the verge of war, but such a matter is of little concern to Monsieur Gustave H., the Grand Budapest\'s devoted concierge.

The locals tell them that if they remove the tablet, ""the end will come"".</p>', u'<p>In present-day <a href=""/wiki/New_York_City"" title=""New York City"">New York City</a>, night guard Larry Daley and his favorite exhibits at the <a href=""/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History"" title=""American Museum of Natural History"">American Museum of Natural History</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt"" title=""Theodore Roosevelt"">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Attila"" title=""Attila"">Attila the Hun</a>, <a href=""/wiki/Sacagawea"" title=""Sacagawea"">Sacagawea</a>, Dexter the <a href=""/wiki/Capuchin_monkey"" title=""Capuchin monkey"">Monkey</a>, miniatures Jed and Octavius, and Pharaoh Ahkmenrah, which come to life every night, are hosting the reopening of the Hayden Planetarium. The museum has a new wax figure <a href=""/wiki/Neanderthal"" title=""Neanderthal"">Neanderthal</a> resembling Larry named Laaa. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that his tablet is corroding, which has adverse effects on the exhibits; they go berserk during the event, causing panic. Larry berates the exhibits, and goes home to find his son Nicky throwing a party. Nicky isn\'t so sure about college and wants to take a year off to plan his own future.</p>', u'<p>Larry discovers that former night watchman Cecil Fredericks was the boy who found the tablet in 1938. Larry reunites with Cecil and tells him about the tablet deteriorating. Cecil realizes that the locals\' warning that ""the end will come\u201d meant that the tablet\'s magic would end. He mentions that Ahkmenrah\'s parents were sent to the <a href=""/wiki/British_Museum"" title=""British Museum"">British Museum</a>.

He eventually yields to Larry\'s request, and pretends that he is still director.</p>', u'<p>Larry and Nicky travel to the museum. The security guard Tilly lets them in. When Larry enters, he sees his exhibit friends also came along. Laaa is instructed to stand guard while the others search for Ahkmenrah\'s parents. They encounter a <a href=""/wiki/Triceratops"" title=""Triceratops"">Triceratops</a> skeleton and a <a href=""/wiki/Xiangliu"" title=""Xiangliu"">Xiangliu</a> statue along the way, but a deluded wax figure replica of <a href=""/wiki/Lancelot"" title=""Lancelot"">Sir Lancelot</a> helps them fight off both exhibits. Meanwhile, Jed and Octavius fall into a ventilation shaft, landing in a <a href=""/wiki/Pompeii"" title=""Pompeii"">Pompeii</a> exhibit just before the model of the volcano <a href=""/wiki/Mount_Vesuvius"" title=""Mount Vesuvius"">Mount Vesuvius</a> erupts. Dexter, who Larry sent to find them, appears and stops the volcano\'s flow to save them.</p>', u'<p>The gang finds Ahkmenrah\u2019s parents, and his father, Merenkahre, reveals the tablet was meant to keep his family together forever and is endowed with the power of <a href=""/wiki/Khonsu"" title=""Khonsu"">Khonsu</a>, god of the moon, and needs frequent exposure to moonlight to retain its magic. If the tablet doesn\'t get moonlight exposure soon, it will die, and so will the exhibits. Lancelot steals the tablet, then leaves to find his Lady <a href=""/wiki/Guinevere"" title=""Guinevere"">Guinevere</a>. The gang splits up to find Lancelot, but Tilly locks Larry and Laaa in the employee break room until Laaa head-butts the door open. The gang leaves the museum to continue the search while Laaa stays behind to keep Tilly detained, during which, they become attracted to each other. The <a href=""/wiki/Trafalgar_Square"" title=""Trafalgar Square"">Trafalgar Square</a> lion statues corner them; Larry distracts the statues with his flashlight and the search continues.</p>', u'<p>They catch up with Lancelot at a <i><a href=""/wiki/Camelot_(musical)"" title=""Camelot (musical)"">Camelot</a></i> <a href=""/wiki/Musical_theatre"" title=""Musical theatre"">musical</a>, starring <a href=""/wiki/Hugh_Jackman"" title=""Hugh Jackman"">Hugh Jackman</a> as <a href=""/wiki/King_Arthur"" title=""King Arthur"">King Arthur</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Alice_Eve"" title=""Alice Eve"">Alice Eve</a> as Guinevere, chasing him to the roof. By now, the New York exhibits are dying. Lancelot, realizing the quest was about them, hands over the tablet; Larry readjusts it and the moon restores it, reviving the exhibits. Back at the museum, the New York exhibits decide that Ahkmenrah and his tablet belong there, even though that means they will no longer come to life at night. As the others leave, Lancelot reveals he has tamed the Triceratops skeleton from earlier, and Larry tells Tilly that tomorrow night she will have the best job ever. After returning to New York, Larry spends a final few moments with the exhibits before sunrise.</p>', u""<p>Three years later, Larry has given up his job as a night watchman to become a teacher, and a traveling British Museum exhibition comes to the museum. Tilly gives the tablet to Dr. McPhee, whose job Larry had saved by taking the blame for the chaos at the Hayden Planetarium reopening. She shows him that all the exhibits have come to life because of the tablet's power and are partying in the museum. Larry looks at the flashing party lights in the museum from across the street and smiles.</p>""]"

2014,Germany,The Maze Runner,boxofficemojo,United States,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maze_Runner_(film),"[u'<p>A 16-year-old boy wakes up inside an underground service elevator with no memory of his identity. A group of male youths greet him in a large grassy area called the Glade that is enclosed by tall, stone walls. Every month, a new boy and supplies arrive in the elevator. The boys, who call themselves Gladers, have formed a rudimentary society with each assuming specialized tasks. Alby, their leader and the first to arrive in the Glade, says every boy eventually recalls his name, but none remember their past. The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding the Glade may provide the only way out. During the day, designated Runners search the Maze for an escape route, returning before nightfall when the entrance closes. No one has ever survived a night inside the Maze.</p>', u""<p>While in a competition with another boy, named Captain Gally, the boy suddenly remembers his name is Thomas. The next day, Thomas is attacked by Ben, a Runner delirious from being stung by a Griever \u2013 deadly techno-organic creatures that roam the Maze at night. Ben is forced into the Maze and left to die as there is no cure for what the Griever infected him with. Minho, the lead Runner, and Alby later retrace Ben's steps inside the Maze. Minho reappears at dusk dragging Alby, who is stung, but they are unable to reach the closing entrance in time. Thomas spontaneously runs into the Maze to help but all three are trapped. During the night in the Maze, Thomas and Minho tie Alby up high on the Maze wall to hide him from the Grievers, but Minho abandons Thomas when a Griever emerges from the center of the Maze. Thomas slides under the Maze wall, managing to hide from a Griever. Later, Thomas finds Minho and his actions during the night keeps them alive, and he kills a Griever by tricking it into a narrow, closing passageway thus causing it to be crushed, making him the first to ever survive a night in the Maze and kill a Griever. To the other boys' astonishment, they return the next morning.</p>"", u'<p>The next morning, the first-ever girl arrives in the elevator. She apparently recognizes Thomas though he cannot remember her. A note says that ""She is the last one ever"". Thomas, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Zart enter the Maze. They locate the Griever corpse and remove a beeping mechanical device from inside it. Gally claims Thomas has jeopardized the fragile peace between the Gladers and the Grievers and wants him punished, but Newt, the group\'s second-in-command, instead designates Thomas a Runner. Minho shows Thomas a scale model of the Maze he has built, based on his three years of exploration. The Maze\'s numbered sections open and close in a regular sequence that might be a code. The device is numbered to correspond to a certain section within the Maze. With the mechanical device, they may be able to find an escape route.</p>', u'<p>The girl, Teresa, has two syringes filled with an unknown substance. One is used on Alby, and he gradually recovers from the Griever sting and begins regaining his memories. Minho and Thomas venture back into the Maze and discover a possible exit but are nearly trapped, barely making it back to the Glade.</p>', u'<p>That night, the Maze entrance does not close while others open, letting Grievers pour in. A massacre ensues as the Gladers, practically defenseless against the Grievers, struggle to fight back or hide. Zart, and several others are killed during the attack. Thomas is assaulted by Gally after the chaos, who blames him for everything that has happened. Thomas, who has had disconnected memory flashes since arriving, stabs himself with a severed Griever stinger in an attempt to revive his memory. The others inject him with the last anti-venom. Unconscious, he recalls that he and Teresa worked for the organization that created the Maze, W.I.C.K.E.D. (World in Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department); the boys unknowingly have been test subjects for an experiment. Thomas awakens and shares this information with Newt, Minho, Chuck, and Teresa.</p>', u'<p>Meanwhile, Gally has taken command and intends to sacrifice Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers to restore the peace. Most of the Gladers are swayed to free Thomas and Teresa and attempt escaping the Maze, but Gally and a few others refuse to leave. Fighting Grievers as they go, Jeff and a few others are killed. The survivors (Thomas, Teresa, Newt, Minho, Chuck, Frypan, Winston, and a few others) eventually enter a laboratory strewn with dead scientists and technicians. A woman named Ava Paige in a video recording explains that the planet has been devastated by a massive <a href=""/wiki/Solar_flare"" title=""Solar flare"">solar flare</a>, followed by a pandemic of a deadly, incurable virus called the Flare that affects the brain of the afflicted. We learn that the Gladers appeared to be immune to the virus. The Gladers learn that they were part of an experiment studying the way their brains worked as a resistance to the virus. At the end, the woman in the video shoots herself as the lab is being attacked by men with military-style weapons but dressed more like mercenaries. Gally suddenly appears armed with a gun he found. Delirious from a Griever sting, he insists they must stay in the Maze, then aims at Thomas intending to kill him in revenge for the Glade\'s destruction. Minho kills Gally with a spear, but not before Chuck is fatally shot protecting Thomas, who is devastated by his friend\'s death. Masked armed men rush in and take the group to a helicopter. As they fly over the Maze, it is revealed to be placed in a vast desert wasteland. Eventually, the helicopter approaches a ruined city.</p>', u'<p>The scene ends with the supposedly-dead scientists meeting in a room. The leader, Paige, notes that the experiment has been a success; the survivors are now entering Phase Two.

When Lord Cotys orders Ergenia to be executed for her betrayal, Hercules is encouraged by Amphiaraus to believe in himself just as everyone believes in him. In a show of inhuman strength, Hercules breaks free of his chains, saving Ergenia and slaying the wolves with his bare hands.

When the Millers reach the compound, they find out that the amount of marijuana they were picking up is not ""a smidge"" as Gurdlinger had informed them, but actually two tons. Because of the extra load of the marijuana on the RV, one of the <a href=""/wiki/Radiator"" title=""Radiator"">radiator</a> hoses breaks while going up a steep incline.

One-Eye appears and is about to shoot everyone, but Don comes out of his camper and subdues him.

Chester invites Flint, his biggest fan, to work at Live Corp, where he meets Chester\'s assistant Barb, a talking orangutan with human intelligence. Six months later, Flint humiliates himself during a promotion ceremony when his invention, the ""Celebrationator"", explodes. Meanwhile, Chester is informed that his search-parties on the island have been attacked by monstrous cheeseburgers named Cheespiders (a combination of a Cheeseburger and a Spider) which are learning how to swim.

In the jungle, Manny confirms Sam\'s suspicions when he reverses the Live Corp logo to reveal the ""Live"" as ""Evil"" spelled backwards.

Upon realizing Chester\'s intentions, the group is then ambushed by Evil Corp employees.</p>', u""<p>Flint finds the FLDSMDFR, but notices a family of cute marshmallows and becomes hesitant to destroy the machine. Chester immediately seizes control of the FLDSMDFR and announces his plot to make his updated line of food bars out of the foodimals. A crushed Flint is knocked into the river but rescued by the marshmallows. Flint is taken to his father, and they and the foodimals all work together to allow Flint and Barry to infiltrate the Evil Corp building that is under construction on the island. Barry frees the trapped foodimals while Flint confronts Chester, who threatens to make food bars out of his friends. Chester makes numerous holograms of himself to overwhelm Flint, but Flint uses the Celebrationator to expose the real Chester, allowing Flint to rescue his friends. An army of foodimals led by Barry arrive and fight Chester's employees. Chester tries to make off with the FLDSMDFR, but is thwarted by Barb, who has a change of heart and Chester gets eaten by a Cheespider. With the island safe from Chester V and Evil Corp destroyed, Flint returns the FLDSMDFR to its place and frees it from Chester's control and the foodimals continue to live in peace as more are born.

As Irving leaves tearfully, one GOC member comes out to assure him that they'll keep their eyes on Billy. Irving drives away, but quickly starts to miss Billy. He turns the car around and drives back to the bar to get Billy back, just as Chuck is showing off his bad parenting by denying Billy any food. Irving calls Billy to him, but Chuck prepares to fight him.

A drone arrives and begins to destroy the stasis chambers. Jack saves Julia, but the drone kills the remaining survivors.

Their leader Malcolm Beech (<a href=""/wiki/Morgan_Freeman"" title=""Morgan Freeman"">Morgan Freeman</a>) wants Jack\'s help to destroy the Tet by reprogramming a captured drone that contains ten stolen fuel cells attached to a nuclear device. He tries to convince Jack that everything he knows is a lie, but Jack does not believe him; Beech releases them, saying the truth can be found in one of the forbidden radiation zones.</p>', u'<p>En route back to Tower 49, Jack and Julia go to the Empire State Building where Julia tells Jack that she is his wife. Their team, which included Vika, was heading towards Titan when they encountered the Tet, an alien ship, and was diverted to investigate it. Since she was in stasis, she doesn\'t know what happened after they left. They fly back to Tower 49 but Vika, monitoring their movements, refuses entry and reports to Sally that she and Jack are not ""an effective team"". Sally activates a disabled drone hidden inside the tower that kills Vika but is destroyed by Julia. Jack and Julia escape with the other drones in pursuit. Jack\'s ship is damaged and they jettison in the forbidden zone, which lacks the warned-of radioactivity. They encounter Tech 52 Jack, an exact clone of Jack, and during a scuffle Julia is shot. Seeing Julia, Tech 52 Jack falters and experiences the same visions Tech 49 Jack experienced. After incapacitating and tying up Jack 52, Tech 49 Jack flies to Tower 52, finding a Vika clone there. He obtains medical supplies and returns to treat the wounded Julia.</p>', u'<p>After an evening at the lake-house Jack built, the two return to the Scavs. Beech reveals that the Tet is the hostile alien force, mining the Earth\'s resources while eliminating humanity. In 2017, the Tet arrived in orbit and destroyed the Moon, to devastate and disorient the human population. Massive earthquakes and tsunamis than destroyed most major cities, and millions more starved to death in the chaos. Soon afterwards the Tet landed waves of troopships, containing thousands of Jack clones programmed purely to kill. After the surviving humans were reduced to only a handful, about 50 years ago the Tet moved on to its second phase, using massive water pump machines to suck Earth\'s oceans dry for fuel, guarded by patrol drones which were serviced and maintained by a new generation of Jack and Victoria clones. ""Sally"" is just a computer generated image that the Tet uses to communicate with these ground crews, based on the head of the original <i>Odyssey</i> mission\'s ground crew.</p>', u""<p>Tracking Jack's biometric readings, the Tet sends drones to breach the complex, which Jack helps the others defend. Beech is gravely injured and the captured drone is damaged beyond repair. The humans try to regroup but fear an imminent attack. At Julia's suggestion, Jack communicates with the Tet via Sally, agreeing to turn over Julia to her. The Tet wants Julia because it believes that, as Jack's wife, a new set of clones based on her will make a more effective team than the Jack and Vika clones. After saying goodbye and placing Julia in a stasis chamber, Jack flies to the Tet while listening to the <i>Odyssey</i>\u200d\u200a'\u200bs flight recorder and learning the fate of its commander, astronaut Jack Harper: he, Vika and Julia were crew members aboard the <i>Odyssey</i>, which was originally an exploration mission to Titan. The mission was re-routed by the real Sally at mission control to investigate the Tet, then near Saturn's orbit and therefore close to the original trajectory. Originally appearing inactive, the Tet began to pull the spacecraft towards it. Sensing danger, Jack jettisoned the sleep module, an emergency escape pod programmed to orbit Earth, to save the crew members in stasis. Jack and Vika were then captured by the Tet.</p>"", u""<p>While entering the Tet, escorted by two drones, Jack glides past thousands of pods containing Jack and Vika clones. Upon final interrogation, he tells a doubting Sally he believes this is the only way Julia will survive and is granted access into the Tet's main control center. Now deep inside the Tet, Jack unloads and opens the sleep chamber which surprisingly contains Beech and a fuel cell bomb. They trigger the bomb, destroying the Tet and shutting down the attacking drones before they reach the human base, with Tech 49 Jack and Beech being killed in the process. On Earth, Julia awakens from the stasis chamber at the lake-house in time to see the Tet destroyed. Three years later, Julia and her young daughter are living in the lake-house.

Her own father is among them, and as she tries to convince him that there's nothing wrong with her, she slowly loses control and eventually it becomes clear that she is in fact possessed. In response to this her father pours flammable liquid on her, sets her on fire, then shoots her in the head.</p>"", u'<p>Some time later, David (<a href=""/wiki/Shiloh_Fernandez"" title=""Shiloh Fernandez"">Shiloh Fernandez</a>) and his girlfriend Natalie (<a href=""/wiki/Elizabeth_Blackmore"" title=""Elizabeth Blackmore"">Elizabeth Blackmore</a>) meet up at a cabin in the woods with his sister Mia (<a href=""/wiki/Jane_Levy"" title=""Jane Levy"">Jane Levy</a>), and their friends Eric (<a href=""/wiki/Lou_Taylor_Pucci"" title=""Lou Taylor Pucci"">Lou Taylor Pucci</a>) and Olivia (<a href=""/wiki/Jessica_Lucas"" title=""Jessica Lucas"">Jessica Lucas</a>). The goal is to help Mia overcome her <a href=""/wiki/Heroin"" title=""Heroin"">heroin</a> addiction. David and Mia\'s dog Grandpa is there too. David had moved to another city years before, leaving a younger Mia alone to attend to their late, mentally ill mother. Eric looks at some old photos of himself, David, Mia, and Olivia together, lamenting how David has not been there for them for quite a while, and their own faded friendship. Olivia says it does not matter since he has decided to be there for Mia and them now.</p>', u'<p>The cabin that is owned by David and Mia\'s family is apparently broken into. Mia keeps complaining of a terrible smell and Olivia, a registered nurse, gives her some medicine to help her through the recovery. Grandpa, the dog starts smelling a carpet and pushing it. David goes over to it at moves it. The group discovers blood on the floor leading to the basement. A smell coming from under the floor leads David and Eric to a hidden room where they discover rotting animal corpses, a shotgun, and a book entitled <i><a href=""/wiki/Necronomicon"" title=""Necronomicon"">Naturom Demonto</a></i>. Recognizing witchcraft practices, Eric starts studying the book out of curiosity. He utters a few phrases aloud, cuts himself on the page of the books and awakening the demons to take hold. Mia is walking in the rain in circles, she senses the awakening and vomits. She sees someone in the woods and asks the group to leave. They refuse, believing that she is just suffering from <a href=""/wiki/Drug_withdrawal"" title=""Drug withdrawal"">withdrawal</a> and will do anything to get out. Furious that they don\'t believe her, she steals keys and jumps out her window. She leaves alone in the car, but on the way out a mysterious, raggedy girl appears in the middle of the road, causing her to crash the car into a pond. She emerges from the wreck and walks out of the pond. Trying to return to the cabin on foot, she hears someone call her name and looks around. The ghoul appears out of the lake behind her. She runs into the woods to escape and is entangled by the deformed branches of a possessed tree. The girl appears in front of her and appears to be a demonic form of Mia. Black tar-like vines emerge from the girl\'s mouth and penetrate Mia, slithering into her, beginning her possession.</p>', u'<p>David and Olivia are looking for and find Mia in shock, and take her back to the cabin. Mia tells David that whatever attacked her in the woods is now in the cabin with them, but he doesn\'t believe her, still convinced that she is hallucinating due to drug withdrawal. After finding Grandpa beaten to death just under the shed, David goes and confronts Mia and finds her <a href=""/wiki/Scalding"" title=""Scalding"">scalding</a> herself in the shower. Eric recognizes the same scene depicted in the witchcraft book. David tries to drive her to a hospital, but flood waters have blocked the way. Possessed Mia, smiles evilly.</p>', u'<p>After returning to the cabin, Olivia attempts to treat Mia as much as her training will allow and gives her a sedative. The now fully possessed Mia shoots David in the shoulder with the shotgun and speaking in an altered voice tells the group, ""You are all going to die tonight."" Mia falls to the floor appearing unconscious. When Olivia tries to retrieve the gun, Mia reawakens, overpowers Olivia, and vomits blood on her face. She throws Mia int the cellar to contain her, locking it. Olivia retreats to the bathroom to clean herself, and retrieves a second sedative as Eric tries to explain the possession. She sees herself possessed in the mirror. The book opens to a page depicting a woman holding a knife in one hand and her face in the other. Olivia attempts to leave the room and is stopped by an unseen entity, she pees herself. Eric does not hear Olivia and goes to check on her. Eric happens upon Olivia cutting into her cheek with broken glass, which Eric also recognizes as a scene depicted in the book. Eric begins to back away and slips on Olivia\'s skin of her cheek. Olivia then attacks Eric stabbing him in the chest with the mirror shard and repeatedly attacking him with the needle that is in the other hand. He throws her off, breaking a part of the toilet off and she falls smashing her head on the shower edge. The possessed Olivia, starts crawling towards Eric again with another mirror shard and he grabs the broken piece of toilet and bludgeons her to death.</p>', u""<p>While David tends to Eric's wounds with duct tape in the cabin's shed, he sends Natalie into the cabin to get water and sugar. A crying Mia lures Natalie into the suddenly opened cellar. Natalie descends into the basement where Mia has her back turned to Natalie. Mia turns and Natalie attempt to retreat upstairs. The stair breaks and Natalie tries to crawl out without falling. Just as she manages to crawl out she is pulled back and knocked unconscious. She awakens to Mia trying to violate her. Natalie grabs a box cutter and tries to defend herself. Mia grabs it and cuts her own tongue in half while licking the blade. She bites Natalie's hand, and shoves her split tongue into Natalie's mouth.</p>"", u""<p>Eric explains to David that according to the book, the demon called the Taker of Souls must consume five souls in order to unleash a being called the Abomination. Hearing Natalie's screams, David returns to the cabin to rescue her, and closes the cellar on Mia once again, chaining it closed.</p>"", u'<p>Natalie attempts to clean the wound and as the \'infection\' starts to crawl up her arm, she falls to the floor. It stops for a second and Natalie looks at the arm and grabs a meat saw, and then tries to avoid possession from the bite wound by severing her arm, and it apparently works. Mia berates Natalie from the trap door, warning her not to cut her arm off. As David tends to Natalie\'s wounds using duck tape, Eric explains that they need to leave and they discuss their next move. Eric explains that Mia must be ""purified"" either by live burial, dismemberment, or burning; this will end her possession and the demon\'s assault. As they debate, it is revealed that severing Natalie\'s arm only delayed the inevitable and a now possessed Natalie attacks the two men with a nail gun, which she has also used on herself. She repeatedly shoots Eric and David tackles Natalie causing her to drop the nail gun. He pulls the nails from his leg and looks up, but Natalie is gone. Eric says, ""Get the gun before she does."" David sees her reflection in the T.V. as he is crawling towards the shotgun. She hits him repeatedly with a metal bar until Eric shoots her with the nail gun. She turns back to Eric and beats him, splitting one of his hands in half. David shoots Natalie\'s other arm off with the shotgun, causing the demon to leave her body before she bleeds to death, confused, in David\'s arms.</p>', u'<p>David takes the injured Eric outside, planning to burn Mia with the whole cabin, but when she starts to sing their mother\'s lullaby, he can\'t bring himself to do it. He decides to bury her alive instead. He digs a grave outside, then descends into the basement to capture Mia, but is caught by surprise: Mia comes out of corner and pushes David into the corner well to drown him. In the ensuing struggle, David is saved when Eric knocks Mia out, but not before she manages to stab him with the box cutter she split her tongue on. As Eric dies from his overwhelming wounds, he forgives David for the past several years. David sedates Mia, putting her in a clean dress and placing a bag over her head, and puts her in a freshly dug grave. Mia awakens half buried; she is still possessed and tries to convince David to unbury her. He sees through her facade and buries her. After she dies, he digs her up and uses an improvised <a href=""/wiki/Defibrillation"" title=""Defibrillation"">defibrillator</a> to attempt to revive her, as the demon has been <a href=""/wiki/Exorcism"" title=""Exorcism"">exorcised</a> and she is human again. However, the makeshift battery runs out of power and the revival seems to fail. However, as David is returning to the cabin to retrieve the keys to his Jeep, she calls to him. She is saved. She puts on her boots and David returns inside, to retrieve the keys. Having forgotten about the possibility of Eric being possessed after his death, David is mortally wounded by a stab wound in the neck with pliers by a now-possessed Eric. David grabs Mia who has rushed in and returns her to the door. He locks Mia out of the cabin, engaging Eric by himself. Eric says in an altered voice, ""He\'s coming."" David then uses the shotgun to ignite a nearby gasoline can, engulfing the cabin in flames, killing both Eric and himself.</p>', u'<p>With their deaths, blood rains from the sky as the Abomination, who looks similar to Mia in her possessed demonic state, rises from the ground and starts chasing her. Mia attempts to hide and flee but the abomination always manages to find her. She crawls through the hole into the shed and retrieves the chainsaw. However she has to fill the chainsaw with fuel to make it run. The abomination in the shed repeatedly thrusts a machete through the thin walls and strikes Mia. Mia manages to craw out and under the jeep and then severs one of the Abomination\'s legs when it comes after her again. It continues its pursuit, crawling now, eventually overturning David\'s Jeep onto Mia\'s arm, breaking her wrist. As the Abomination crawls around the jeep and closes in on Mia, Mia tries to reach for the chainsaw. The abomination says, ""I will devour your soul you junkie, bitch."" Mia pulls herself free from the jeep, completely severing her hand in the process. She then grabs the chainsaw nearby, and stands up. The abomination again says, ""I will eat your soul!"" Using the chainsaw, Mia then says, ""Eat this"" shoving the saw into its mouth, down its spine and up through its head, cutting it in half. The remainders of the Abomination sink into the ground and the blood rain stops. Sunlight begins to shine through the forest trees as Mia walks away into the forest.

The Jaegers are initially effective, but many are destroyed as the Kaijus grow more powerful and their attacks become more frequent.</p>', u""<p>In 2020,Raleigh and his brother Yancy Becket, are instructed to suit up to fight a Kaiju labeled Knifehead, a designated category III in danger and size. They wade out into the Pacific in their Jaeger, Gipsy Danger, with orders to kill the Kaiju and save the city. They are told to ignore the small fishing boat, Saltchuck that is in the middle of the battle. Raleigh ignores the command, and attempts to save the ship. He and Yancy believe they are victorious after shooting Knifehead with the plasma cannon built into the right arm, and prepare to leave. Knifehead reappears and attacks as the Jaeger is turned, ripping off Gipsy Danger's left arm, and causing Raleigh permanent damage. Knifehead then attacks the head, ripping it open and killing Yancy. Raleigh pilots the Jaeger solo, killing Knifehead, but receiving severe damage to Gipsy Danger in the process. He limped the Jaeger ashore on the Alaskan coast, much to the amazement of a father and son who witness the event. Raliegh emerges from the broken hull of Gipsy Danger dazed and bloodied before falling to the ground unconscious while the father sends his son off to get medical help. Traumatized by the sudden loss of his brother while still mentally connected to him, Raleigh quits the Jaeger Program.</p>"", u'<p>In 2025, the participating governments deem the Jaeger program unsustainable and discontinue and decommission it in favor of building defensive coastal walls, collectively called the Kaiju Wall. The four remaining Jaegers are redeployed to <a href=""/wiki/Hong_Kong"" title=""Hong Kong"">Hong Kong</a> to protect the coast until the walls are completed. Jaeger commander Marshall Stacker Pentecost resolves to make a last-ditch attempt to end the Kaiju threat by destroying The Breach with a <a href=""/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"" title=""Nuclear weapon"">nuclear weapon</a>, even though past nuclear strikes on the portal have been unsuccessful. Stacker plans to follow through with the initial Jaeger objective, regardless of the lack of funding. He flies to the Kaiju Wall, where Raleigh has been working for the past five years. Raleigh and the other workers are watching the news, which shows the Wall failing and a Kaiju named Mutavore attacking Sydney, Australia, before it\'s stopped by the Jaeger Striker Eureka, piloted by Herc and Chuck Hansen. Chuck asserts that the reason the Jaeger program failed was because of weak pilots. Stacker asks Raleigh to re-join the program, but he declines. He and his brother were still connected when he died and he cannot stand the mental pain another time. Stacker asks where he would rather die: building the Wall, ""or in a Jaeger,"" fighting Kaiju. Raliegh reluctantly returns to the Jaeger Program.</p>', u""<p>Raleigh travels to Hong Kong with Pentecost and begins the process of finding a new co-pilot.When they arrive in Hong Kong, they are greeted by Mako Mori, later revealed as Pentecost's adopted daughter and director of the Jaeger refurbishment project. She shows Raleigh around the Shatterdome. They get into an elevator with two scientists, Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb, who comprise the entire research team for the base. The Jaegers stationed in the Shatterdome are all the remaining mechs; Crimson Typhoon, which features three arms and is piloted by the Wei triplets. The second is called Cherno Alpha, piloted by a pair of Russians, Sasha and Aleksis Kaidonovsky. Herc and Chuck Hansen pilot the only Mark-5, Striker Eureka. Mako then shows Raleigh to Gipsy Danger, who has been rebuilt with additional weapons for the final mission. She then shows him to his room, right across from hers.</p>"", u""<p>Pentecost reluctantly allows Mako to participate in a test run with Raleigh. During the test, Mako relives the traumatic memory of the Kaiju attack (Onibaba) that orphaned her and nearly discharges <i>Gipsy Danger</i>\u200d\u200a'\u200bs weapons in the hangar. Pentecost deems her unfit for combat and grounds both her and Raleigh. She tells him that he will meet with the candidates for his partnership soon, and that she hopes to be a pilot one day. Her record is impressive, but she makes it clear that Stacker will not allow her to fight. She then goes to her room, but watches him from the door as he changes. In the mess hall, Raleigh is invited by Herc to sit with him and Chuck, but Chuck takes an instant dislike to Raleigh because he believes him to be weak, and fears that he will endanger their mission. Herc apologizes for his behavior, making it known that his son is a hothead and very impulsive. Stacker then goes to meet with the scientists. Gottleib tells him that, based on the data, they can expect a Double Event soon, and a triple soon afterward. Newton asserts that he believes he can connect with the Kaiju via Drift, the same as pilots in the Jaeger program do. Stacker dismisses him, telling him that it's impossible, and goes with Gottlieb's information instead.[5]</p>"", u""<p>Against his better judgement, Stacker appoints Mako as Raleigh's partner, and they do a test run in Gipsy Danger. Stacker is called away by a frightened Gottlieb, who tells him that Newton attempted the link anyway, and has collapsed in seizures on the floor. Chuck and Raleigh fight when Chuck insults Mako, but are broken up by Herc, while Raleigh and Mako go in to talk to Stacker. Stacker tells Mako that she is too inexperienced, and won't be piloting again, and Mako leaves. Raleigh strikes out at Stacker, saying that he knows why he won't let Mako fight, since he's been in her memories. The kaiju that was hunting Mako was killed by the Jaeger that Stacker piloted, and he took her under his wing after that. Raleigh says that he is only hindering Mako, but Stacker says that he has made up his mind.[</p>"", u""<p>A pair of Category IV Kaijus, codenamed Otachi and Leatherback are detected by Tendo attack Hong Kong. Striker Eureka, Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha are deployed to fend off the Kaiju. Herc and Chuck are supposed to remain back by the island as a last resort to avoid being damaged, while the Wei Tang triplets and the Kaidonovskys attack the two Kaiju. The Kaiju swiftly destroy Crimson Typhoon, prompting Herc and Chuck to assist. Striker Eureka arrives and joins the battle against Leatherback and Otachi, but not before the creatures overpower Cherno Alpha. Otachi then moved to attack Hong Kong. Leatherback triggers an EMP, disabling both Striker Eureka and the command center. Tendo says it will take two hours to get it all back online, so Stacker deploys Mako and Raleigh, as Gipsy Danger's nuclear core was unaffected by the EMP. They defeat Leatherback, saving the Hansens as well as Striker Eureka, though Herc breaks his arm after Leatherback lands a blow on the mech's head.</p>"", u'<p>Meanwhile, scientist Newton Geiszler creates a device that allows him to drift with a damaged Kaiju brain. He discovers that the Kaijus are not merely wild animals, but are <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Bioweapon"" title=""Bioweapon"">genetically engineered weapons</a>, hive-minded at the vanguard of an invading alien army called the Precursors. They came to Earth once before during the time of the Dinosaurs, but there was too much oxygen in the atmosphere and that the humans practically terraformed it for them. Stacker instructs Newton to do another link, with a fresh brain, which he can get from the black market dealer Hannibal Chau. Seeking more information, Pentecost orders Geiszler to repeat the experiment on an intact Kaiju brain and sends him to Hannibal Chau, a criminal who sells Kaiju body parts on the black market. When he finds him, he is astounded to see that Chau has equipment and specimens that even the government doesn\'t have. Newton tells Chau that he wants to establish another link, and Chau tells him that it\'s dangerous because now the Kaiju know where Newton is and will want to kill him. He dismisses Newton as Otachi storms the city, and Newton heads to a public Kaiju bunker.[5]</p>', u""<p>The bunker is attacked by Otachi, who breaks through the shelter's roof while searching.

While running, Newton slips as the infant asphyxiates itself with its umbilical cord, only to eat Chau before finally dying.</p>"", u""<p>Stacker decides to put the final plan into motion early, knowing that they won't survive the triple attack Gottlieb predicted. The final plan is to go through the portal and destroy it with a high-yield nuclear bomb, so that the Kaiju can no longer get through. Gipsy Danger is supposed to run protection, giving enough time for Chuck and Herc to get through the portal to deploy the bomb. However, with Herc injured, and little time to find another pilot, Stacker decides to partner with Chuck, knowing that they could all die if he didn't.</p>"", u""<p>Herc and Chuck say goodbye to each other, knowing that Chuck will most likely not return. Meanwhile, Newton has decided to link with the newborn brain, and Gottlieb joins him. They realize that the plan will not work, and return to the base.

Geiszler and his lab partner Hermann Gottlieb link with the infant Kaiju's brain and learns that The Breach only opens for Kaiju DNA, which is why all previous attempts to destroy the portal have failed.</p>"", u'<p>The two remaining Jaegers commence their bombing run on The Breach. Pentecost volunteers to pilot <i>Striker Eureka</i>, which is the only one capable of carrying the bomb.The two Jaegers engage the Triple Event Kaiju - Scunner, Raiju and Slattern - with the latter the strongest of the three, the first Category V Kaiju as well as the largest ever encountered. Both Jaegers take heavy damage in the process.<i>Striker Eureka</i> is too damaged to release the bomb. Geiszler warns the two Jaegers that they must take a Kaiju into the Breach with them for the attack to succeed.Stacker and Chuck decide to deploy the bomb, sacrificing Striker and themselves to try and kill Scunner and Slattern to give Mako and Raleigh a chance to get through the portal. Pentecost and Chuck Hansen detonate the bomb in order to clear a path to the portal for Raleigh and Mako. Since <i>Gipsy Danger</i> is powered by a <a href=""/wiki/Nuclear_reactor_core"" title=""Nuclear reactor core"">nuclear reactor core</a>, it can be used as an improvised bomb to destroy The Breach. The resulting explosion destroys <i>Striker Eureka</i> and kills Pentecost and Hansen, Raiju, but only injures Slattern.</p>', u""<p>The battle with Raiju and Scunner leaves <i>Gipsy Danger</i> crippled. A heavily damaged Gipsy approaches the portal but is attacked by a weakened, though not dead Slattern. Gipsy tackles Slattern, killing it with her sword and chest turbine, then passes through the portal latched onto its corpse. The Gipsy Danger crew are losing oxygen rapidly, so Raleigh gives Mako his share, and deploys her ejection pod. He then proceeds to manually overload the nuclear reactor just as Gipsy enters the Anteverse. Raleigh ejects himself out and back to Earth seconds before Gipsy Danger is set to self-destruct and detonates, on the other side of the portal, decimating the alien forces, their base and sealing off the Breach. Raleigh is able to jettison his escape pod and return to Earth before the portal collapses.

Mako swims to Raleigh\'s pod, opening it, and hugging him in relief. He jokes that he couldn\'t breathe because she was holding him and embracing too tightly. Tendo tells them that rescue helicopters are on their way to get them, and that they\'ve done well. Herc then addressed the Shatterdome as ""Marshal,"" telling them to stop the war clock that counted down how much more time until the next attack, and the PPDC breaks out in cheers.</p>', u'<p>After initial credits roll, a mid credits sequence shows Hannibal Chau slicing himself out of the belly of the infant kaiju that swallowed him whole, demanding his missing shoe.

Once free, Dubois recruits her injured men and they head toward the Alps, forcing the animals to proceed to London despite incomplete rehearsals. Alex finds Vitaly preparing to leave and convinces him to stay by reminding him of how he enjoys performing the impossible. He suggests that he uses <a href=""/wiki/Hair_conditioner"" title=""Hair conditioner"">hair conditioner</a> as a safer lubricant to perform his flaming ring jump as well as fix his damaged fur. As a result, Vitaly\'s stunt is performed perfectly and the show is a spectacular success.

Though the penguins are able to foil Dubois\' plan, Alex is forced to confess that the four of them are just zoo animals trying to get home, disappointing the others who feel used and lied to by the four of them. The zoo animals and circus go their separate ways, but arrive in New York City at the same time. Realizing how much their adventures have changed them, the zoo animals find that their true home was with the circus. Before they can go back, however, Dubois tranquilizes and captures them, before being discovered by the zoo staff, who believe she is responsible for returning the missing animals. Julien and the penguins manage to get to the circus and convince the circus animals to rescue their friends.</p>', u'<p>Back at the zoo, Alex awakens to find that he alone with Marty; Melman and Gloria are in their old enclosures, which are now surrounded by tall chain-link fences. Dubois steps on stage to receive a million-dollar check of appreciation from the zoo, which she rejects. She secretly loads a poison-filled dart into a gun that she hides inside a foam finger in preparation for publicly executing Alex. The circus animals arrive in time to stop her and a massive brawl occurs, where the animals use all of what they had developed as part of their revamped act. As the group tries to leave, Stefano is stranded and Dubois attempts to kill him. Alex manages to save him with a performance of the ""Trapeze Americano"", a trick he made up while pretending to be part of the circus, Alex then defeats Dubois and escapes with all of his friends.

Immortal children were those who were frozen in childhood, and because they could not be trained nor restrained, they destroyed entire villages. They were eventually executed, as were the parents who created them, and the creation of such children outlawed.

The Volturi arrive prepared for battle, led by <a href=""/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#The_Volturi"" title=""List of Twilight characters"">Aro</a>, who is eager to obtain the gifted members of the Cullen coven as part of his guard. Aro is allowed to touch Renesmee, and is convinced that she is not an immortal child. Irina is brought forth and takes full responsibility for her mistake, leading to her immediate death. Aro still insists that Renesmee may pose a risk in the future, validating his claim that battle is necessary. Before any violence, Alice shares with Aro her vision of the battle that is to come, during which both sides sustain heavy casualties, including Aro himself. Aro believes her, giving Alice and Jasper an opportunity to reveal their witness (which is a half mortal half vampire just like Renesmee). The witness proves that he is mature, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not a threat. The Volturi leave without a fight.</p>', u'<p>Back at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella together with Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee. Edward reads Alice\'s mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her. Alone in the meadow, Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward a peek into her mind, showing him every precious moment she and Edward shared together and the two share a kiss after Bella telling Edward, ""No one has ever loved anyone as much as I love you"", and both Edward and Bella saying they\'ll love and be together forever.

When Pi tries feeding Richard Parker through the cage bars, since his religious interests lead him to believe that animals had souls, his enraged father tells him that Richard Parker is dangerous and would kill him if it had the chance, and so his father forces Pi to witness Richard Parker killing a goat to prove his point.</p>', u'<p>At 16, Pi is still affected by the incident, causing him to be gloomy and depressed, until he meets a dancer named Anandi, with whom he develops a relationship.

J then discovers that K was responsible not only for capturing Boris, but for deploying the ""ArcNet"", a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth and caused their extinction.</p>', u'<p>Boris travels back in time to kill the young Agent K. With history altered so that K is long-dead, J finds that only his memory has been unaffected, and no one from the Agency understands his obsession with K until Agent O, the new Chief, deduces that there has been a fracture in the space-time continuum. With K out of the picture, the ArcNet was never deployed, and there is nothing to protect the present-day Earth from the Boglodite invasion, so J must travel back in time to stop Boris and save K. Back in 1969, he travels to Coney Island, knowing from the Agency\'s records that, in 1969, Boris will commit a murder there. He finds Boris, but is discovered and arrested by 1969 K, who prepares to wipe his memory, but decides at the last minute to investigate J\'s claims. K and J follow clues, leading them to a bowling alley, and then to <a href=""/wiki/The_Factory"" title=""The Factory"">The Factory</a>, where they come across an alien named Griffin, who is in possession of the ArcNet. Griffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris is coming and escapes, but he later captures him.

They are stopped by military police, but Griffin shows a skeptical colonel the future, convincing him of the importance of their mission, and the colonel assists them in reaching the launch site. As the agents climb up the rocket\'s launch tower, both 1969 Boris and 2012 Boris attack them. Using his time-travel device, J evades an attack by 2012 Boris and knocks him off one of the launch tower bridges. K shoots off 1969 Boris\'s left arm (which restores the timeline), knocking him off the tower as well. The ArcNet is attached and deploys successfully when the rocket launches, with 2012 Boris being incinerated by the rocket\'s exhaust. 1969 Boris then attacks K on the beach, but the colonel pushes K down and out of the way, taking the hit himself instead. K then kills Boris (which 2012 K had regretted not doing) instead of arresting him as he originally did. The colonel\'s young son inquires about his father, but rather than tell him the truth, K wipes his memory and tells him only that his father is a hero. Observing from afar, J realizes that the young boy is himself, the colonel was his father, and that K has actually been watching over him all his life. J returns to 2012 with the timeline restored, reunites with K, and subtly thanks him for everything he has done.</p>']"

They are publicly humiliated, losing any chance of winning. Four months later, newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell (<a href=""/wiki/Anna_Kendrick"" title=""Anna Kendrick"">Anna Kendrick</a>) has no desire to attend college, but she is forced to do so by her father (<a href=""/wiki/John_Benjamin_Hickey"" title=""John Benjamin Hickey"">John Benjamin Hickey</a>), a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship. Wishing she could instead pursue a career as a music producer, Beca spends her time making <a href=""/wiki/Mashup_(music)"" title=""Mashup (music)"">mash-up</a> mixes of songs and takes up an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson (<a href=""/wiki/Skylar_Astin"" title=""Skylar Astin"">Skylar Astin</a>).</p>', u'<p>When Beca\'s father discovers she has not been attending classes, he comes to her with a proposition: if she joins a club and still does not want to remain at college after one year, he will allow her to leave school, and he will pay for Beca to move to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. After some persuasion from Chloe Beale (<a href=""/wiki/Brittany_Snow"" title=""Brittany Snow"">Brittany Snow</a>) the co-leader of the Bellas along with Aubrey, she reluctantly joins the Barden Bellas. Aubrey does not initially approve of recruiting Beca, but yields nonetheless due to a desperate need for members and Beca\'s talent.

In spite of their old set list, the group manages to place second, which sends them to the semi-finals. A short scuffle after the competition leads to Beca accidentally smashing a window with the trophy which alerts a police officer standing outside who then arrests her. Jesse tries to help by calling Beca's father, who then tells Beca that he will no longer pay for her to move to Los Angeles because of the incident. This infuriates Beca, which turns her budding friendship with Jesse sour. In the meantime, Beca suggests to the Bellas to try to be more daring, but Aubrey insists that they will win with the repertoire the group has always used in the past.</p>"", u'<p>At the semi-finals, Beca provides an impromptu back-up of one of her favorite songs into the ""traditional"" song on the Bellas\' set list to reinvigorate the crowd after they seemed to have lost interest. The Bellas come in third in the competition behind the Treblemakers and the Footnotes. Even though the audience seemed to enjoy Beca\'s remix, Aubrey becomes furious with Beca, who in turn quits. When the Footnotes are later disqualified from the national competition because the lead singer was in high school, the Bellas are called to take part instead. The Bellas re-form after spring break, with the notable exception of Beca. During rehearsals, Chloe stands up against Aubrey\'s stubbornness. The group starts to fall apart, which sparks a fight. Meanwhile, Beca tries to apologize to Jesse, which he declines. Beca then apologizes to the Bellas for her actions during the semi-finals and asks to have another chance, which Aubrey eventually allows. After having a group heart-to-heart conversation, the Bellas decide to adopt Beca\'s more modern and original music style. Meanwhile, group leader Bumper (<a href=""/wiki/Adam_DeVine"" title=""Adam DeVine"">Adam DeVine</a>) leaves the Treblemakers after being offered a job as a back-up singer for <a href=""/wiki/John_Mayer"" title=""John Mayer"">John Mayer</a>.

Blocking their escape are Jill and Umbrella troops, consisting of clones of Alice\'s deceased allies, an ""evil"" version of Rain, modified after the original, a former deceased Umbrella soldier and Alice\'s ally, <a href=""/wiki/List_of_Resident_Evil_characters#Carlos_Oliveira"" title=""List of Resident Evil characters"">Carlos Olivera</a> (<a href=""/wiki/Oded_Fehr"" title=""Oded Fehr"">Oded Fehr</a>), and also James ""One"" Shade (<a href=""/wiki/Colin_Salmon"" title=""Colin Salmon"">Colin Salmon</a>), leader of an Umbrella commando team that was <a href=""/wiki/Resident_Evil_(film)"" title=""Resident Evil (film)"">sent in The Hive</a>.

The group escapes the Las Plagas Undead, and reach the elevator; however, an Uber-Licker captures Becky and kills ""good"" Rain by throwing her into a pillar, breaking her neck. Alice pursues the Uber-Licker, while the others fight off Jill\'s group; Barry and One are casualties. Alice rescues Becky despite Leon\'s discouragement. During their escape, they arrive at a cloning facility where Alice and Becky see copies of themselves. When Becky asks Alice if she really is her mother, Alice says ""she is now"". The Uber-Licker follows them inside, as Alice drops grenades, and fires a grappling hook, escaping the explosion. The explosives at the entrance go off, flooding the place (killing Olivera and the remaining Umbrella soldiers) and propelling the elevator upwards with Leon and Luther. Alice and Becky also survive, having used the ventilation system.</p>', u'<p>The group awaits pickup but is ambushed by a commandeered Soviet submarine, from which Jill, the ""evil"" Rain, and a captured Ada emerge. With new orders to kill Alice, Jill attacks. Rain injects herself with the Las Plagas parasite to gain superhuman strength and healing; she knocks out Ada and fights Leon and Luther. Alice manages to destroy the scarab device on Jill\'s chest, returning her to normal, though, <a href=""/wiki/Resident_Evil:_Afterlife"" title=""Resident Evil: Afterlife"">unlike Claire</a>, she retains her memory. Rain kills Luther with a blow to the chest, and knocks Leon out; Alice, realizing they can\'t kill Rain, shoots at her footing.

The release of the film <i><a href=""/wiki/House_of_Dark_Shadows"" title=""House of Dark Shadows"">House of Dark Shadows</a></i> in September of that year is also thought to have caused TV ratings to fall, perhaps because of parents who attended the film with their children and, seeing the amount of blood spilled across the screen, discouraged their children\'s choice of television viewing material.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-9""><a href=""#cite_note-9""><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Beginning in the fall of 1970, several ABC stations across the country dropped the show due to falling viewership.

Thus, the network began weeding out supposedly unproductive programming. Despite its relatively high station clearances for its timeslot and low production costs, <i>Dark Shadows</i> fell victim to the purge mainly because of its young audience, who usually did not make decisions about the purchasing of household goods and food products for the family, which were the two chief industries that bought airtime on daytime television in that era. Practically no other daytime show skewed so much under the 18\u201335 demographic threshold as <i>Dark Shadows</i> did.

In addition and probably more decisively, the program experienced a precipitous drop in its ratings during its last two years on the air, falling from a peak of 8.4 in the 1968\u20131969 television season to a 5.3 in 1970\u20131971.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-11""><a href=""#cite_note-11""><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Reflecting on the series\' cancellation, in an interview included in a 2005 DVD release, series creator <a href=""/wiki/Dan_Curtis"" title=""Dan Curtis"">Dan Curtis</a> welcomed the show\'s cancellation, feeling it had run out of fresh ideas: ""I was just hoping it was going to end.

Though defeating many Warhoon, Carter is ultimately overpowered and is saved when a Helium ship intervenes.

In different Zodangan forms, Shang explains to Carter the purpose of Therns and how they manipulate the civilizations of different planets into total self-destruction, also revealing Sab Than's secret plan that he will kill Dejah once he marries her and destroy Helium and rule Barsoom, at the same time completing the course the Therns have set for Barsoom.

Carter embarks on a long quest, looking for clues of the Therns' presence on Earth and hoping to find one of their medallions; after several years he appears to die suddenly and asks for unusual funeral arrangements \u2014 consistent with his having found a medallion, since his return to Mars would leave his Earth body in a coma-like state. He makes Burroughs his protector, giving him clues about how to open the tomb.</p>"", u'<p>The film reverts to the present, where Burroughs runs back to Carter\'s tomb and opens it, hoping to find Carter\'s body. A Thern, who had been following Carter over the ten years he\'d returned in the form of a man with a bowler hat, appears holding a knife, having followed Burroughs. But as he prepares to strike, both he and Burroughs see the tomb is empty. A shot suddenly rings out and the Thern drops dead. Carter emerges and confesses to Burroughs that he never found a medallion. Instead, he devised a scheme to lure a Thern into revealing himself in order to get that Thern\'s medallion. After suggesting to Burroughs that he enjoy his life on Earth and to try writing books (alluding to the fact that Burroughs is the real-life author of the ""Barsoom"" novels), Carter takes the Thern\'s medallion, whispers the code, and is then transported back to Barsoom.</p>']"

Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty, being <a href=""/wiki/Layoff"" title=""Layoff"">laid off</a>. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the $48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive.

When Scott arrives at Niko\'s apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter. While watching the <a href=""/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship"" title=""Ultimate Fighting Championship"">UFC</a> at Niko\'s apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives $10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only $750 to the loser. Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his $48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott\'s students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs. Scott then begins fighting in small MMA fights and gradually gaining higher amounts of money for the school.</p>', u'<p>Scott has been pursuing the school nurse, Bella, and they share moments revealing affection for each other, while also rekindling Scott\'s passion for teaching.

Marty reminds Scott that even if he does not win, he has inspired the students, which is their real purpose. Scott has no answer to his dangerous opponent, Ken Dietrich, who is angered that his original opponent canceled and that he is stuck with a man that ""does not deserve"" to be at the UFC.

Whilst that George is hitting a punching bag, when her mother tells her to be friendly to their upcoming guests. George is not happy of having them stay with them and tells her mother that she doesn\'t need any friends. When the three siblings arrive together with Mrs. Miller, Uncle Quentin is packing, because he plans to stay the next days on Kirrin Island (""Felseninsel"") where he wants to concentrate on his research work.

An intoxicated Beth angrily confronts Thomas and Nina. She is later hit by a car and seriously injured in what Thomas suspects was a suicide attempt. Nina begins to witness strange happenings.

The next morning, Nina wakes up alone and late for rehearsal. When she arrives at the studio, she finds Lily dancing as the Swan Queen. Furious, she confronts Lily and asks her why she did not wake her up that morning. After Lily admits she spent the night with a man whom she met at the club, Nina realizes she dreamed the encounter. Nina\'s hallucinations become stronger as she sees Thomas and Lily have sex in a backstage area and Beth stabbing herself in the face at the hospital with a nail file which Nina drops bloodied in the elevator.</p>', u""<p>Nina later has a violent argument with her mother, after which she passes out.

The first act goes well, until Nina is distracted by a hallucination during a lift, causing her partner, playing the Prince, to drop her. Distraught, she returns to her dressing room and finds Lily there. Lily announces she is to play the Black Swan. Nina shoves her into a mirror, shattering it. Lily, seemingly dead, awakens, and her face changes shape, now a copy of Nina's. The doppelganger starts to strangle Nina, who then grabs a shard of glass and stabs her rival in the stomach, apparently killing her. The doppelganger's face reverts to that of Lily's. Nina hides the body and returns to the stage to dance with passion and sensuality.</p>"", u'<p>Sprouting feathers, her arms become black wings as she finally loses herself and is transformed into a black swan.

Back in her dressing room before the final act, Nina is congratulated by Lily, revealing that their fight was, again, imaginary. The mirror, however, is still shattered. Nina removes a small shard from her own body and realizes she had stabbed herself. Dancing the last scene, in which the White Swan throws herself off a cliff, Nina spots her mother weeping in the audience. As Nina falls backward onto a hidden mattress, the theater erupts in thunderous applause. Thomas and the cast gather to congratulate her\u2014only to find that she is bleeding.

Will\'s boss Steven Jacobs terminates the project and orders chimp handler Robert Franklin to euthanize the chimps. After doing as ordered, Franklin discovers that Bright Eyes had recently given birth and understands the reason why she was disturbed. He convinces Will to save the baby chimp\'s life by taking him home temporarily. Will\'s father Charles, who is suffering from Alzheimer\'s, names the chimp ""<a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Caesar_(Planet_of_the_Apes)"" title=""Caesar (Planet of the Apes)"">Caesar</a>"", in reference to William Shakespeare\'s play <i><a href=""/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)"" title=""Julius Caesar (play)"">Julius Caesar</a></i>, from which he can, despite his deteriorating mental condition, cite long passages from memory.

After the island across from Lilliput, Blefuscu, infiltrates commandos to kidnap Princess Mary, Gulliver manages to break free of the plough-machine he is forced to work and then rescues the princess from being kidnapped.

Phaedra organizes a riot, using the chaos to escape with Theseus, Stavros, and the other slaves. Theseus decides to pursue Hyperion and attempts to capture a boat, but he and his allies are overwhelmed by Hyperion\'s forces. Poseidon purposefully falls from Olympus into the ocean causing a tsunami that wipes out Hyperion\'s men. Phaedra sees another vision of Theseus standing near a shrouded body.

The group returns to Phaedra\'s temple while Hyperion and his forces are away at Mount Tartarus. At the temple, Stavros and Theseus are lured into an ambush and Theseus loses the Epirus Bow. Outnumbered by Hyperion\'s men, Ares directly intervenes to save Theseus and Athena provides the men with horses to reach Mount Tartarus. Zeus arrives and angrily kills Ares for disobeying his command. Zeus tells Theseus and his allies to let Ares\' killing be a warning to both the gods and them that they will receive no more help from the gods and he must justify the faith Zeus has in him alone. Before leaving with Athena, Zeus tells Theseus to prove him right. The lost Epirus Bow is brought to Hyperion.</p>', u'<p>Theseus, Stavros, and Phaedra travel to Mount Tartarus.

The following day, Hyperion uses the Bow to destroy Mount Tartarus\' seemingly indestructible gate. Theseus leads the Hellenic army to war against the Hyperion forces, killing Lysander. Hyperion ignores the battle, storms through to Mount Tartarus killing Helios and Cassander and uses the Epirus Bow to breach the mountain and free the Titans before Stavros and Theseus can stop him. The force of the release knocks the mortals down. Stavros takes the Epirus Bow and kills a Titan, but is killed by the other Titans. Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, Heracles and Apollo arrive and battle the Titans while Theseus fights Hyperion. Zeus destroys the Epirus Bow, and the gods prove more than a match for the Titans, but they are overwhelmed by their sheer numbers, with all but Zeus and Poseidon being killed. Theseus kills Hyperion and Zeus collapses Mount Tartarus on the Titans. As the mountain is collapsing, Zeus picks up Athenas body and ascends to Olympus along with a badly wounded Poseidon. The collapsing mountain wipes out Hyperion\'s men. The mortally wounded Theseus is also transported to Olympus for his sacrifice and given a place among the gods.</p>', u'<p>Several years later, Theseus\' story has become legend and Phaedra has given birth to Theseus\' son <a href=""/wiki/Acamas_(son_of_Theseus)"" title=""Acamas (son of Theseus)"">Acamas</a> (Gage Munroe).

However, after little success, she ends up working as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant by 1990, and meets Ian (<a href=""/wiki/Rafe_Spall"" title=""Rafe Spall"">Rafe Spall</a>), an aspiring comedian who is hired soon after. Dexter is travelling the world while drinking and having sex promiscuously with a succession of girlfriends, but they keep in contact via phonecalls and letters. He then visits Emma on 15 July 1991 and, to get her out of her rut, suggests they go away for the weekend. They flirt back and forth and it\'s made clear that Emma may have deeper feelings for him, but since she knows that Dexter is not boyfriend material, nothing comes of it and two more years fly by.

Also, his mother appears very unimpressed with the nature of his television show and reveals that she no longer believes he is a nice man. On the same day, Emma goes out on a date with Ian. Although there appears to be no romantic spark between them, she knows he means well and so they continue to date anyway.</p>', u'<p>By 1995, Emma is now a school teacher and has moved in with Ian.

Gothel discovers that Rapunzel\'s hair has the flower\'s healing properties but that attempting to take just the hair by cutting it destroys its power, so she kidnaps Rapunzel and raises her as her own daughter in an isolated tower. Once a year, the King and Queen release <a href=""/wiki/Sky_lantern"" title=""Sky lantern"">sky lanterns</a> on Rapunzel\'s birthday, hoping for their daughter\'s return.</p>', u""<p>Nearing her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel asks Gothel for permission to leave the tower and discover the source of the lanterns, but Gothel refuses. Elsewhere, a thief known as Flynn Rider has stolen Rapunzel's crown from the kingdom and inadvertently discovers the tower after ditching his cohorts, the Stabbington brothers. Rapunzel captures Flynn and discovers the crown, but is unaware of its significance. Rapunzel plans to show Flynn to Gothel in order to prove she can take care of herself, but when Gothel becomes enraged at Rapunzel's insistent desire to leave, she asks for a special paint that will take Gothel three days' round trip to obtain and return. Gothel agrees and departs. Rapunzel convinces Flynn to escort her to see the lanterns in exchange for the crown.</p>"", u'<p>During their excursion, Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a <a href=""/wiki/Pub"" title=""Pub"">pub</a> filled with the frightening people Gothel warned Rapunzel about, but who instead are charmed by Rapunzel\'s innocence. When the royal soldiers appear searching for Flynn, the pub regulars help the pair escape. The soldiers give chase, led by Maximus, one of the lead horses in the royal army, and locate them at a dam. The dam is inadvertently breached, and the resulting deluge traps Flynn and Rapunzel in a flooding cave. Fearing this is the end, Flynn reveals his real name is Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel starts to reveal that her hair glows when she sings, but realizes that is their key to escape as her hair provides enough light to find a way out of the cave. Eugene and Rapunzel take refuge in a forest where Gothel, now in league with the Stabbingtons, gives the crown to Rapunzel and suggests using it to challenge Eugene\'s interest in her.</p>', u'<p>The next morning, Maximus finds the pair and tries to capture Eugene, but Rapunzel arranges a truce in honor of her birthday. The group reaches the kingdom and enjoys the festivities, culminating in an evening cruise as the lanterns are released. There, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown. When he sees the Stabbingtons on the shore, Eugene leaves Rapunzel and intends to let them have the crown. Instead, the brothers tie Eugene onto a boat and confront Rapunzel, claiming Eugene is escaping with the crown. Gothel then stages a rescue by betraying the brothers and returns Rapunzel to the tower as Eugene and the Stabbingtons are arrested by the royal guards.</p>', u""<p>Back at the tower, Rapunzel recognizes the symbol of the kingdom, which she had subconsciously incorporated into her paintings over the years. Realizing that she is the long-lost princess, she confronts Gothel. As Eugene is being led to execution, he is rescued by the Snuggly Duckling regulars and carried back to Gothel's tower by Maximus. Eugene enters the tower by climbing Rapunzel's hair, only to find Rapunzel bound with chains and gagged with a handkerchief. Gothel then stabs him with a knife and attempts to leave with a struggling Rapunzel. Rapunzel agrees to lifelong captivity if she is allowed to heal Eugene, but before she has the chance to save him, Eugene slices off her hair, turning it from golden blonde to brown and destroying its magic. Gothel's age rapidly catches up to her, and she falls from the tower, disintegrating into dust. As Eugene dies, a heartbroken Rapunzel's tear, which still contains a bit of the sun's power, lands on his cheek and restores his life. The two return to the kingdom, where Rapunzel is re-united with her parents. The kingdom breaks out in celebration and Eugene is pardoned for his crimes. Rapunzel and Eugene eventually marry.</p>""]"

Should Cobb succeed, Saito tells Cobb he will use his influence to clear Cobb of a murder charge, which will allow Cobb to return home to his children. Although Arthur claims that inception is impossible as it is always possible to trace the origin of an idea, Cobb, claiming past experience, accepts the offer and sets about assembling his team: Eames (<a href=""/wiki/Tom_Hardy"" title=""Tom Hardy"">Tom Hardy</a>), a conman and identity forger; Yusuf (<a href=""/wiki/Dileep_Rao"" title=""Dileep Rao"">Dileep Rao</a>), a chemist who concocts a powerful <a href=""/wiki/Sedative"" title=""Sedative"">sedative</a> for a stable ""<a href=""/wiki/False_awakening"" title=""False awakening"">dream within a dream</a>"" strategy; Ariadne (<a href=""/wiki/Ellen_Page"" title=""Ellen Page"">Ellen Page</a>), an architecture student tasked with designing the <a href=""/wiki/Labyrinth"" title=""Labyrinth"">labyrinth</a> of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Professor Stephen Miles (<a href=""/wiki/Michael_Caine"" title=""Michael Caine"">Michael Caine</a>). Saito insists on accompanying the team to verify their success. When Ariadne shares a dream with Cobb, he reveals to her that his subconscious recreates Mal, and she appears frequently in his dreams as a hostile force.</p>', u'<p>When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a flight back to Los Angeles, which the team uses as an opportunity to isolate Fischer. Cobb sedates him, bringing him into a shared dream with the extractors. At each level in the layered dreaming, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a ""<a href=""/wiki/Hypnic_jerk"" title=""Hypnic jerk"">kick</a>"" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members who have entered another dream layer deeper. While death in a dream would, under normal circumstances, cause the dreamer to wake up, the sedatives used to stabilize the dreams would not allow that. Thus, death during the mission will result in entering ""<a href=""/wiki/Limbo#Non-religious_usages"" title=""Limbo"">Limbo</a>"", an expanse of infinite raw subconscious from which it is very difficult to escape.</p>', u'<p>In the first level, the team enter Yusuf\'s dream of a rainy Los Angeles.

Even worse, a barreling freight train plows down the avenue, batting aside cars and trucks and cutting off Cobb, Yusuf and Ariadne from the rest of the team. Eames temporarily takes the appearance of Fischer\'s godfather, Peter Browning (<a href=""/wiki/Tom_Berenger"" title=""Tom Berenger"">Tom Berenger</a>), to suggest Fischer reconsider his father\'s will. Yusuf drives the team in a van as the rest are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. On this level, the extractors recruit Fischer, convincing him that his kidnapping was orchestrated by Browning and that they are Fischer\'s subconscious protectors. They persuade him to go down another level to explore Browning\'s subconscious (whereas it is actually a ruse to enter his own). The third level is a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames. Meanwhile, Yusuf, under assault in the first level, accidentally initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, removing the gravity of Arthur\'s dream world and causing an avalanche in Eames\' dream. Arthur is forced to improvise a new kick using an elevator that will be synchronized with the van hitting the water, while the team in Eames\' dream races to finish the job before the new round of kicks.</p>', u'<p>Saito succumbs to his wounds, and Cobb\'s projection of Mal sabotages the plan by killing Fischer, sending them both into Limbo.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-13""><a href=""#cite_note-13""><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to find Fischer and Saito, while Eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives. Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology, where they spent ""fifty years"" of experienced time constructing a world from their shared memories while seemingly growing old together. Cobb confesses that in order to ensure Mal would leave Limbo, he had implanted the idea that her reality was false in her head in the first place; this was how he knew that inception was possible. The experience destabilised Mal, and left her convinced that she was still dreaming even after they had woken up. In an attempt to ""wake up"" from real life, Mal committed suicide, and tried desperately to persuade Cobb to do so too by incriminating him in her death. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S. His children, who appear frequently in his dreams, are in California in the care of Professor Miles, who is Mal\'s father.</p>', u'<p>Through his confession, Cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in Limbo to search for Saito. Ariadne pushes Fischer off a balcony, resuscitating him at the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a vision of his father telling him to be his own man, and split up his father\'s company. All team members other than Cobb and Saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in Limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team\'s sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf\'s dream hits the water. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo (shown <i><a href=""/wiki/In_medias_res"" title=""In medias res"">in medias res</a></i> at the start of the film) and the two remember their arrangement, presumably shooting themselves and waking to outer-world reality back on the airplane, where the entire team and Robert Fischer have awakened.</p>', u""<p>Upon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb successfully passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and his waiting father-in-law accompanies him to his children.

Marcus Higgins (<a href=""/wiki/David_Spade"" title=""David Spade"">David Spade</a>) is a slacker and <a href=""/wiki/Lothario"" title=""Lothario"">lothario</a>. All five friends regularly harass each other in comedic fashion throughout the film: Lenny for being <a href=""/wiki/Wealth"" title=""Wealth"">rich</a>; Eric for being overweight; Kurt for being skinny and not being more useful; Rob for his way of saying ""Maize!"" and for having a much older wife; and Marcus for being sexually juvenile.</p>', u'<p>When the five friends soon find out that Buzzer has died, they all reunite for the first time in three decades and later return to their hometown with their families to pay tribute to Buzzer at his private funeral.

However, Lenny cannot stay for the whole weekend because Roxanne has a fashion show in <a href=""/wiki/Milan"" title=""Milan"">Milan</a>. While at the lake house, Lenny is annoyed in which their kids would rather play video games than spend time outdoors, so that he and the other friends are forcing their kids to play outside during their stay instead. At a local restaurant, Lenny talks to his old nemesis, Dickie Bailey (<a href=""/wiki/Colin_Quinn"" title=""Colin Quinn"">Colin Quinn</a>), who is still upset at Lenny because he allegedly had his foot on the 3-point line instead of behind it,at which Lenny should have scored 2 points not 3 thus not winning the game. Dickie challenges him and his friends to a rematch, but Lenny declines after noting that Dickie is decidedly out of shape. The next day, the five friends spread Buzzer\'s ashes into the woods. Rob becomes depressed during this event, lamenting his failed marriages, and later says his three daughters from the past marriages are coming. After having to deal with Jasmine, Rob goes and hangs out with his friends, who were fishing. After making some jokes on Rob, the others elect to cheer him up with a game of arrow roulette. Rob remains in the circle the longest, making him the winner, but the arrow hits directly through Rob\'s foot. When Gloria tries to use a maize-covered poultice, Rob snaps at Gloria. Lenny gets the kids interested in talking on cup-phones and Roxanne accidentally tells Becky that she is the ""Tooth Fairy"". Happy that they are enjoying the same kind of fun he had as a child, Lenny installs an extensive cup-phone network in the house.</p>', u'<p>Roxanne ultimately figures out that it is more important to stay at the lake house than going to Milan. The five friends decide to go to a water park, where Bean learns to drink milk out of a carton and Marcus flirts constantly with Jasmine and Amber, having bought them skimpy bikinis. Rob kicks a ride attendant down a water slide, who insults Bridget for being less attractive than her sisters. Eric ignores Donna\'s warning about a chemical in the kiddie pool that turns urine blue, and chaos results when he and his friends urinate in the pool. The spouses try to attract a hunk, but he is laughed off due to his high-pitched voice. Later, Lenny and the group go to the zip line and meet Dickie again, this time with his own group of friends and former teammates, including Wiley (<a href=""/wiki/Steve_Buscemi"" title=""Steve Buscemi"">Steve Buscemi</a>), who ends up in the hospital after sliding down the zip line by his feet. Lenny teaches his son how to shoot a perfect shot during basketball. Afterwards, the friends end the night by sharing their dance with their spouses. The next day, Roxanne picks up Lenny\'s phone and confronts him on lying about canceling their flight trip before she agreed on staying for the family instead of going to Milan. Eventually, everyone starts to tell the truth about their feelings and lives. On their final day at the lake house, Lenny and his buddies are challenged once again to a basketball rematch by Dickie. At the game-deciding shot, Lenny purposely misses in order to allow Dickie and his team to win. Before the end of the film, Marcus plays another game of arrow roulette, this time with an entire crowd of people, and everyone takes off with Wiley accidentally getting his foot impaled by the arrow.</p>']"

With their help, Alice lands on the prison\'s roof and learns <i>Arcadia</i> is not a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, <i>Arcadia</i> has stopped broadcasting and has remained still for 4 days; since the prison is surrounded, there is no safe way to reach the ship. Claire remembers arriving at the <i>Arcadia</i>, but nothing else.</p>', u'<p>As they need to reach the <i>Arcadia</i>, Luther takes Alice to the last inmate; <a href=""/wiki/Chris_Redfield"" title=""Chris Redfield"">Chris Redfield</a> (<a href=""/wiki/Wentworth_Miller"" title=""Wentworth Miller"">Wentworth Miller</a>), who insists he fell victim to a prank from the other inmates, and will reveal an escape route for freedom.

Out of options, they free Chris, who explains Claire is his sister. Chris reveals the prison keeps an armored car they can use to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins breaking down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go deeper into the prison to get guns from the armory; Luther and Claire reinforce the gate to keep the undead at bay. Alice, Chris and Crystal make it to the armoury, but zombies kill Crystal. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine and it would take a week to fix. Desperate to live, Bennett shoots Angel, abandons Yong, and heads for <i>Arcadia</i> in Alice\'s airplane.</p>', u'<p>The Axeman breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies into the facility. With no other choice, the group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, whom Alice and Claire then face. Alice is knocked out; Claire defends Alice and just before it can kill her, Alice awakes and shoots a hole in its head. The two meet up with Chris at the end of the sewers, but lose Luther to a zombie that drags him back into the tunnels.</p>', u'<p>Alice and the Redfields board the <i>Arcadia</i>, discovering it functional but abandoned.

Alice follows a trail of blood from an empty holding cell deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes <a href=""/wiki/Cannibalism"" title=""Cannibalism"">fresh human DNA</a> can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice\'s DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite bonding with the virus at a cellular level; he believes eating her will give him back control.</p>', u'<p>The Redfields fight Wesker while Alice battles Bennett, who now works for Wesker. Wesker easily overpowers Chris and Claire, but Alice is able to defeat both Bennett and Wesker with help from K-Mart. They lock Bennett in the room with Wesker\'s corpse; Bennett is devoured by Wesker when he revives. Wesker then escapes in an aircraft, activating a bomb on the <i>Arcadia</i>; the plane explodes instead as Alice placed the bomb there beforehand. Unbeknownst to them, Wesker <a href=""/wiki/Parachuting"" title=""Parachuting"">parachutes</a> away from the explosion, while Luther emerges from the sewers, battered but alive. Alice resolves to turn <i>Arcadia</i> into a real haven and broadcasts a new message for any other survivors.

The events of the last few days have been designed by the hospital to break Laeddis\' <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Conspiracy_(crime)"" title=""Conspiracy (crime)"">conspiracy</a>-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Daniels; Dr. Sheehan posed as Aule. The migraines Laeddis suffered were a result of being off his medication. Laeddis is overwhelmed with memories and passes out from the realization.</p>', u'<p>Laeddis awakes back in the hospital, and asked questions regarding his personality by Cawley and Sheehan, which he answers as Laeddis. Cawley notes they had achieved this state nine months prior to Laeddis\' regression, and this is to be his last chance at rehabilitation. As Laeddis relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan, Laeddis refers to Sheehan as Aule and tells him they need to get off the island. Seeing the signs of regression, Sheehan has Laeddis taken by the orderlies to the lighthouse. Laeddis lets himself be taken, but asks Sheehan ""Which would be worse \u2013 to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"", potentially signifying that his regression is only an act.<sup class=""reference"" id=""cite_ref-5""><a href=""#cite_note-5""><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>']"

Jack\'s plan was originally to name Bob as his successor as head of the Byrnes family, but decides to pass the role to Greg, naming him ""The Godfocker."" Despite Greg reluctantly accepting the role, Jack begins to suspect Greg of infidelity when he sees him with a drug representative, Andi Garcia (Alba), who openly flirts with him, and the presence of Sustengo erection pills in Greg\'s house, which prompts Jack to think Greg is no longer sexually attracted to his wife, Pam (Polo). Furthermore, Jack starts to doubt Greg\'s ability to provide for his family when he appears reluctant to send his children to a private school.</p>', u'<p>During a medical conference promoting Sustengo, Greg meets Bob at a bar.

Eventually, following a row at a clinic, Greg runs away from home to his and Pam\'s unfinished new house, where he is paid a brief visit by Andi, who tries to cheer him up with takeout and wine, but Andi soon becomes so drunk that she makes an aggressive sexual pass at Greg. While looking for Greg, so he can apologize to him and bring him home, Jack pulls up to the house and sees, through the window, what looks to him like Greg and Andi having sex, when, in reality, Greg is trying to rebuff Andi\'s advances.

At the end, Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook\'s founding and Zuckerberg\'s own callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury.

His owner, Phil Winslow (<a href=""/wiki/Lee_Pace"" title=""Lee Pace"">Lee Pace</a>), works for Bark Organic dog food. Phil is very strict, from Marmaduke\'s perspective.</p>', u'<p>One day, Carlos tells Marmaduke that he overheard Phil saying that they were being transferred to <a href=""/wiki/Orange_County,_California"" title=""Orange County, California"">Orange County</a>. They move from Kansas into their new house in <a href=""/wiki/California"" title=""California"">California</a>. Phil\'s boss, Don Twombly (<a href=""/wiki/William_H._Macy"" title=""William H. Macy"">William H. Macy</a>), has the goal of getting Bark Organic into every <a href=""/wiki/Petco"" title=""Petco"">Petco</a> store in the country. Phil and Don meet at the dog park to discuss Phil\'s assignment \u2013 an ad campaign to win over Petco. There, Marmaduke meets a beautiful <a href=""/wiki/Rough_Collie"" title=""Rough Collie"">Rough Collie</a> named Jezebel (<a href=""/wiki/Fergie_(singer)"" title=""Fergie (singer)"">Fergie</a>), whose boyfriend is Bosco (<a href=""/wiki/Kiefer_Sutherland"" title=""Kiefer Sutherland"">Kiefer Sutherland</a>), a controlling and violent <a href=""/wiki/Beauceron"" title=""Beauceron"">Beauceron</a> with two <a href=""/wiki/Miniature_Pinscher"" title=""Miniature Pinscher"">Miniature Pinscher</a> minions named Thunder and Lightning (<a href=""/wiki/Damon_Wayans,_Jr."" title=""Damon Wayans, Jr."">Damon Wayans, Jr.</a> and <a href=""/wiki/Marlon_Wayans"" title=""Marlon Wayans"">Marlon Wayans</a>). Bosco intimidates Marmaduke, who does not want to fight.</p>', u'<p>Marmaduke then meets Mazie (<a href=""/wiki/Emma_Stone"" title=""Emma Stone"">Emma Stone</a>), who develops a crush on Marmaduke. He also meets Giuseppe (<a href=""/wiki/Christopher_Mintz-Plasse"" title=""Christopher Mintz-Plasse"">Christopher Mintz-Plasse</a>), a Chinese Crested dog who is afraid of everything, and Raisin (<a href=""/wiki/Steve_Coogan"" title=""Steve Coogan"">Steve Coogan</a>), a highly intelligent but decidedly minute <a href=""/wiki/Dachshund"" title=""Dachshund"">Dachshund</a>. They get together at night and crash a pedigrees-only party thrown by Bosco, only to be scared away by Bosco. Marmaduke asks Mazie to help him get a girl, whom she presumes is herself but is actually Jezebel.</p>', u'<p>Marmaduke has Carlos pretend to be lost in the dog park, and the two stage a fight in front of all the other dogs in order to boost Marmaduke\'s perceived toughness. Marmaduke then enters a dog surfing contest put together as a promotional stunt by Phil to sway <a href=""/wiki/Petco"" title=""Petco"">Petco</a> and beats Bosco, who is an established dog-surfing champion. They get into a fight, which appalls the Petco executives. As a result, Phil hires a dog trainer named Anton to help him control Marmaduke, albeit with little success at first.</p>', u'<p>He then takes Jezebel on Mazie\'s dream date, which the latter watches from afar. While the Winslow family are on Don\'s boat, Marmaduke throws a party, with most residents of the dog park attending save for Mazie, Giuseppe, and Raisin. Bosco crashes the party and discovers it was Carlos at the dog park. He then exposes Marmaduke, who loses his pedigree friends. He is left with no friends and a destroyed house. When the Winslows return (having discovered Phil arranged the stay on Don\'s boat was so they could work on the Petco pitch) and Phil discovers the house in a wreck, he locks Marmaduke outside for the night. Marmaduke runs away, and leaves Mazie a toy that she had given him earlier. Mazie goes to Marmaduke\'s house, and Carlos tells her Marmaduke never returned. She then goes looking for him. Marmaduke in the meantime has met Chupadogra, a wise, elderly <a href=""/wiki/English_Mastiff"" title=""English Mastiff"">English Mastiff</a> (<a href=""/wiki/Sam_Elliott"" title=""Sam Elliott"">Sam Elliott</a>) who is feared throughout Orange County for presumably killing his owner. In reality, he ran away to lead the pack, but they abandoned him. He has spent the time alone in the woods with nothing but a blanket and his old water bowl, which reads ""Buster"". Buster/Chupadogra tells Marmaduke to go home and return to his family while he still has one, and then distracts a <a class=""mw-redirect"" href=""/wiki/Dog_catcher"" title=""Dog catcher"">dog catcher</a>. Marmaduke leaves, but gets lost.</p>', u'<p>In the morning, the Winslows discover Marmaduke missing and begin searching for him. Mazie and the family find him at the same time on the streets, but Mazie falls into the subterranean rainwater conduit after the street below her collapses. Marmaduke jumps in after her and Phil tries to retrieve him, as well as the fire department. The fireman saves Mazie, but loses Marmaduke in the raging water. By this time, Phil has been fired for missing the meeting for the last chance with Petco. He then runs to the aqueduct that the conduits lead to and finds Marmaduke in the raging waters. Phil begs Marmaduke to let go of the branch he\'s holding onto and let the waters carry him to Phil. He reluctantly does, and is saved. Several kids get that on video and put it on <a href=""/wiki/YouTube"" title=""YouTube"">YouTube</a>. Since it generates almost 700,000 hits, Phil is rehired. Phil then talks about moving back to Kansas, but the entire Winslow family wants to stay in California. Marmaduke later confronts the pedigrees, saying that differences shouldn\'t matter, that they\'re all dogs and should have an equal share of the park. Everyone agrees and turn on Bosco, who leaves, after revealing his fear of bees (which Marmaduke is also afraid of). Meanwhile, the YouTube video also wins the company the Petco deal. He and Don begin thinking of new commercials when they ask each other about if the dogs could talk to each other, or even dance.</p>', u'<p>The finale then shows Marmaduke, Jezebel, Mazie, Giuseppe, Raisin, and Buster, among others, dancing and singing ""<a href=""/wiki/What_I_Like_About_You_(song)"" title=""What I Like About You (song)"">What I Like About You</a>"", which turns out to be the commercial. In the end, Marmaduke and Mazie are dating, Marmaduke and Jezebel are friends, and all is well. That night, Marmaduke then farts in Phil and Debbie\'s bed as he winks at the camera.</p>']"
